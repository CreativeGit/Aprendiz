# Aprendiz
A Chrome Extension that changes certain words on websites (such as wikipedia.com) to help students learn multiple languages such as Spanish, French, German and Dutch. 
Advantages:
- Expand your vocabulary in a particular language while browsing the web, and subconciously picking up a language.
- The extension is built in a way in which it will be easy to add more languages over time.

# How To Use this?
If you want to locally install this extension, download the .zip file and extract it. Then, go to chrome://extensions and toggle on Developer Mode. You will see a 'Load Unpacked' option. Then, you will see it in the top right-hand corner of your screen, alongside other extensions. Upon clicking it, you can see a dropdown menu for a language. You may choose from Spanish, French, Dutch and German. Then, visit Wikipedia and you will see some words with a red highlight. Hover over them and you can see the translated version.
